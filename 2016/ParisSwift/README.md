# Reverse Engineering UI

Talk given 16 Mar 2016 at the Paris Swift Meetup.

No one has a monopoly on great ideas and copying things well can be as much of an art form as creating them from scratch. Using a set of simple techniques and tools, we as iOS developers can learn from the best, propagate great concepts and exercise our creativity. In the talk I also share some of the reverse engineering challenges I faced when creating PeekPop, a framework that reimplements Apple's peek and pop 3DTouch interaction in older devices.
